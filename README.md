# Auth_app

**Description**

This project provides a secure and well-structured backend foundation for user authentication and authorization, built with Express.js and MongoDB. It implements essential features for user registration, login, and role-based access control (RBAC).

**Key Features**

* **Robust Authentication:**
  
    - Secure user registration with password hashing using a strong algorithm (e.g., bcrypt).
    - Login functionality with user credential validation.
    - JWT (JSON Web Token) generation upon successful login for secure session management.
* **Flexible Authorization:**
  
    - Role-based access control implemented through middleware (`middleware/auth.js`). This middleware checks the user's role (student or admin) extracted from the JWT and restricts access to endpoints based on defined permissions.
    - Design allows for easy extension to handle additional roles and permissions as your application grows.
 
* **Security Considerations:**
  
    - Password hashing to prevent storage of plain text passwords.
    - JWT with appropriate signing algorithms (e.g., RS256) to ensure token integrity.
    - Best practices for error handling and validation to minimize potential vulnerabilities.

**Setup and Installation**

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)<your-username>/<your-repo-name>.git

2. Install Dependencies
   
    cd <your-repo-name>
    npm install

* **Dependencies:**
  
    - express: Web framework for Node.js
    - mongoose: ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB interactions
    - bcrypt: Secure password hashing library
    - jsonwebtoken: Library for generating and validating JWTs
 
* **Environment Variables**

Create a .env file in the project root directory to store sensitive information like your MongoDB connection URI:

    - PORT = define suitable port number
    - DATABASE_URL = your database url
    - JWT_SECRET = your jwt token
